Identifying and assessing athletic talent in a country as vast and diverse as India is a significant challenge. Aspiring athletes, particularly from rural and remote areas, often lack access to standardized assessment facilities or opportunities to showcase their talent. The absence of reliable and scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from Government support. A set of standard fitness assessment tests - including height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runs (Annexure A) - provides a scientific method to evaluate talent. However, the reach and implementation of such tests remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.

Problem Description

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:

1. Enable athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in the prescribed fitness assessment tests.
2. Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze the recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, or measuring time/distance in runs).
3. Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.
4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.

Innovative Features

1. AI-based Cheat Detection: Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.
2. Offline Video Analysis: Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.
3. Performance Benchmarking: Compare athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback.
4. Gamified User Interface: Use progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation.
5. Auto-Test Segmentation: Automatically detect and segment performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort.

Expected Deliverables

1. A mobile application (Android/iOS) that allows video recording and assessment of athletes performance across the test batteries.
2. AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis, verification of test results, and cheat detection.
3. A secure backend system to transmit data to the Sports Authority of India for further processing.
4. A dashboard for officials to view and evaluate verified performance data.
